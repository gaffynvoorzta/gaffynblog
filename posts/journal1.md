Another feverish sleep last night plagued with **Strange Dreams**, *voices* in *unintelligible languages* trailing off into the void as I wake...

# What
## Does
### It All Mean!!

I am going to need **Several Things** for my `journey`

- **Twine** and **Scissors** *(for `tying` and `cutting` things)*
- **Portable Habitation** *suitably camouflaged*
- **Some Other Stuff** *had it all written down somewhere* 

`They sound like they are getting closer now...`
